Title: Benchmark for RNA-seq Quantification Pipelines
Description: Several quantitative and visualized benchmarks
    for RNA-seq quantification pipelines. Two-replicate
    quantifications for genes, transcripts, junctions or 
    exons by each pipeline with nessasery meta information 
    should be organizd into numeric matrix in order to
